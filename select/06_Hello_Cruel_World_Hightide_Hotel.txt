Hey Dave, what's more cliche than pain?
When was the last time that you had something original to say?
Wouldn't you say it's getting old?
Isn't it time that you things go?
Don't you feel you owe it to yourself to take some steps to stop restricting growth?
Don't you remember hope?
I remember it well.
I think that's why I dwell in the past, or at least the last time I was kind to myself.
I retreat to memory, reliving histories in my head, because it's all that comforts me in stagnancy.
(Reminds me of a time this was worth it) Hey Dave, isn't it about time you finally grew that fucking spine?
Doesn't it only make things worse writing your agonies in verse?
Shouldn't you destroy all those notes and rants before they all destroy you first?
Hasn't it become a curse? No, I still cling to notes.
The raving rants I wrote are kept close. They're archived and filed, or memorized in hopes.
That they may leave a trail which, backwards, leads to where things went wrong, and the instructions to repair the pride I broke.
(Lord knows, they've got to be good for something)
And so I've catalogued each moment and placed them within a timeline composed of thoughts, regrets, and stories that I keep stored within my mind.
And I know they may not mean much within the scope and scale of life, although, for now, they're all I have, and dammit they're all mine.
