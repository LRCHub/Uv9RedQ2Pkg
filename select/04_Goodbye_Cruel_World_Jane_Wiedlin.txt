Let's dream it away
Think it away

No more children hungry or bruised
No more land raped and abused
No animals hunted for fun
It's time to undo the damage we've done

No more people split by their color
No nations hating each other
No women trapped by their sex
No experiments that end in death

Let's dream it away
Think it away
Put the power back in our hands
Dream it away
We'll think it away
Use the power in the mind of man
To say goodbye
Goodbye cruel world

Is it so naïve to believe in love
Why build bombs, we've got more than enough
The planet's ours to use or destroy
Why rob life when life is joy

Let's dream it away
Think it away
Put the power back in our hands
Dream it away
We'll think it away
Use the power in the mind of man
To say goodbye
Goodbye cruel world

Wave goodbye to the past
The whole world looking up at last
We'll work toward the future with all our might
We've got the power to make things right

"""""""""""""""""

No more doctors saving the bank
No world leaders telling us who to thank
No one locked in the chains of liberty
No more graves dug from charity

Let's dream it away
Think it away
Put the power back in our hands
Dream it away
We'll think it away
And use the power in the mind of man

Dream it away
Think it away
Put the power in our hands
Dream it away
We'll think it away
And use the power in the mind of man

Dream it away
Think it away
Put the power back in our hands
Dream it away
We'll think it away
Use the power in the mind of man
To say goodbye
Goodbye cruel world
