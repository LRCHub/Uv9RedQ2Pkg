Don't judge me with your prejudice
Your church and God
Tell me what the hell you got
That I want
Chorus:
You can't save us all, the journey of the sick
We're never very long, in your cruel world
Don't trust me, comfort me with sentiment
You don't mean
Don't flood me, in rivers of medicine
I can't swim
(Chorus)
Hold me, accountable for all I've done
As I, will hold you
(Chorus)
