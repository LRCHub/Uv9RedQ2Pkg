```lrc
[00:16.44] I'm putting you out of your misery
[00:22.30] 'Cause darling you're dragging me down
[00:28.30] I wish I could say that I'm sorry
[00:32.62] But I'm over that, now I'm taking you out
[00:37.32] It's a cruel, cruel world
[00:49.82] 
[01:04.63] I used to see beauty in people
[01:10.30] But now I see muscle and bones
[01:16.38] You know I never wanted to hurt you
[01:20.47] But I'm sorry, my friend, this is the end
[01:40.97] 
[01:25.15] So I'm saying my goodbyes
[01:31.40] Goodbye to my good side
[01:37.13] It only ever got me hurt
[01:40.44] And I finally learned
[01:43.16] It's a cruel, cruel world
[01:49.29] It's a cruel, cruel world
[02:01.79] 
[01:58.38] Erase you from my mind
[02:01.40] I'm sorry, but I
[02:04.29] I'm cutting all the ties
[02:16.29] 
[02:07.26] So I'm saying my goodbyes
[02:13.24] Goodbye to my good side
[02:18.99] It only ever got me hurt
[02:22.29] And I finally learned
[02:25.13] It's a cruel, cruel world
[02:31.30] It's a cruel, cruel world
[02:43.80] 
[02:37.56] Cruel, cruel world
